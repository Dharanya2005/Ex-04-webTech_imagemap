Vellore Fort is a large 16th-century fort situated in heart of the 
Vellore city, in the state of Tamil Nadu, India built by the Emperors of 
Vijayanagara. The fort was at one time the imperial capital of the Aravidu 
Dynasty of the Vijayanagara Empire. The fort is known for its grand 
ramparts, wide moat and robust masonry.The fort's ownership passed from Emperors 
of Vijayanagara, to the Turko-Persian Bijapur sultans, to the Marathas, to the Carnatic
Nawabs and finally to the British, who held the fort until India gained independence. 
The Indian government maintains the fort with the Archaeological Department. 
During British rule, the Tipu Sultan's family and the last King of Sri Lanka, 
Sri Vikrama Rajasinha were held as prisoners in the fort. It is also a witness to 
the massacre of the Vijayanagara royal family of Sriranga Raya. 
The fort houses the Jalakanteswarar Hindu temple, the Christian St. John's Church 
and a Muslim mosque, of which the Jalakanteswarar Temple is famous for 
its magnificent carvings.[1] The first significant military rebellion against 
British rule, the Vellore Mutiny, erupted at this fort in 1806.[2]

The Golden Temple of Vellore is situated in a place called “Malaikodi”. 
The temple held its consecration on the 24th of August in the year 2007.
This ceremony was attended by thousands of devotees.Thus, 
the Golden Temple history does not date back to the era of Vijayanagara 
kings when the majority of the construction in the city was done.
The temple has been done by highly adept artisans. They have done intricate 
and manual work to create this mammoth. The temple has been built on 100 acres 
of land. It has been designed by a Vellore-based architect, Sri. Narayani Peedam.
This has been advanced by Sri Sakthi Amma, also known Narayani Amma, who is a Vellore-based religious leader.
The forehead or crown  of the Temple has some of the most intricate designs ever seen in 
the Indian construction. It is carved with complex art forms in gold and silver. 
The development of this awe-inspiring forehead was completed on 24th August 2007. 
It is believed that more than 1500 kg. of gold was used to make the forehead.
